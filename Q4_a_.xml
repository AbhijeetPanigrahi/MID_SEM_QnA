<!-- Q..  What is XML DOM? Make a institue.xml document with a 2 institute, having five departments 
          which includes name of the course, code of the course and year. Make the DOM tree for institute.xml. -->


<!-- 
XML DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for XML documents. 
It represents the structure of an XML document as a tree-like hierarchical structure,
where each node in the tree corresponds to a part of the XML document. XML DOM allows developers
to manipulate XML documents using programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, etc.,
by providing methods and properties to access, modify, and traverse XML elements.
